# Omnid Robot Teleoperation

## Description

Supported by the McCormick Summer Research Award at Northwestern University, and in collaboration with Professor Matthew Elwin, I have developed a teleoperation feature for the Center for Robotics and Biosystems' unique Omnid robots. This feature includes various control modes specifically tailored for the Omnid robots, facilitating diverse experimental setups. The primary goal is to conduct comparative analyses of human-multirobot and teleoperated robot collaborations, thereby assessing the efficiency and effectiveness of human-robot interaction.

This work initiated the ROS Unified_Teleoperation project. More details are available in my portfolio.

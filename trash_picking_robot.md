## Description

At Weston Robot, a Singapore-based company dedicated to advancing robot adoption across various industries, I participated in the development of a Trash-Picking Robot. My role involved writing the robot arm control software using C/C++ and Python, which integrated seamlessly with the robot's navigation systems. Additionally, I collaborated on implementing machine learning and computer vision techniques.

This internship was instrumental in enhancing my skills in ROS 1, Linux, and GitHub, along with gaining practical experience in OpenCV & YoloV5, Gazebo, and machine learning. It was an invaluable step in my professional development, for which I am deeply appreciative.

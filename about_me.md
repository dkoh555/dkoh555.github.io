# About Me
As a Junior at Northwestern University, I am pursuing a concurrent Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and a Master's in Electrical Engineering, specializing in Robotics & Autonomous Systems.
Hailing from Singapore, my life has been a global journey, with memorable stays in China, the UK, and Saudi Arabia, moving more than seven times. These diverse experiences have profoundly shaped my perspective and adaptability.
My passion for STEM and robotics was ignited early on, kindled by my fascination with video games, movies, and comic books - particularly the 2008 movie 'Iron Man'. Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy cooking, boxing, and scuba diving, while still making time for my original inspirations - video games, movies, and TV shows.
Continuing my journey at Northwestern, I am excited to explore the vast potential of robotics and technology, embracing the opportunities and challenges they offer!

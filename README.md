# Porfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll discover a range of engineering projects showcasing my experience in areas like C/C++ and Python programming, Robot Operating System (ROS), Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), Machine Learning, and Embedded Systems.

While I have a strong interest in robotics, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, I'm also enthusiastic about exploring new and potentially intriguing fields.

My upcoming coursework and projects in January to March 2024 will include SLAM & Navigation for Robotics, Feedback Systems, and Machine Learning.

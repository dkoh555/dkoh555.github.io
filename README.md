# Porfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! Here, you'll discover a range of engineering projects showcasing my experience in areas like C/C++ and Python programming, Robot Operating System (ROS), and Embedded Systems.

While I have a strong interest in robotics, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, I'm also enthusiastic about exploring new and potentially intriguing fields.

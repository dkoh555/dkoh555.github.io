# ROS Package: unified_teleop

(Additional Videos to be Added)

## Description
Under the guidance of Professor Matthew Elwin at Northwestern University, I've developed the Unified Teleop package for ROS2. This teleoperation package package was born from my time working with Northwestern's unique Omnid Robots and is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional and currently-available teleoperation options, providing a versatile tool that can ease and enhance the robotics development process across both academic and professional spheres.

The motivation for Unified Teleop arose from the unique challenges presented by specialized robots like the Omnids. Recognizing that standard teleoperation packages fell short of meeting these robots' nuanced mechanical and software designs prompted the creation of developing this general and versatile package. The result is a ROS2 package that offers seamless compatibility with a broad range of input devices, from the ubiquitous game controller to the more sophisticated Spacenav mice,different customizable modes of control, offering high-levels of flexibility and enhanced control.

Unified Teleop distinguishes itself through several key features designed to maximize adaptability and ease of use:
- Configurable Input Schemes: Tailor your control system to any device supported by a ROS joy package, ensuring a broad compatibility spectrum;
- Custom Output Schemes: Map your robot's movements to the control inputs exactly as you envision it, whether moving forward with the push of a joystick or strafing with a button press.
- Intuitive Control Modifiers: Implement smooth, predictable, and safe control with modifiers such as Rate of Change and Spherical Boundary Radius, that  allow it to be tailored to the design of any robot.
- Versatile Control Messages: Choose between Twist and PointStamped messages to match your robot's communication protocols, offering additional control options.
- Adaptive Control Modes: Whether you prefer the direct mirroring of inputs or incremental control for precise adjustments, Unified Teleop accommodates diverse operational strategies.

This package is the result of an iterative process, improving alongside my developing proficiency in ROS2 and C++. It presented a great opportunity to learn through doing, reflecting the incremental advancements in both the software and my personal development journey in the world of ROS!

This project is currently a work in progress.
